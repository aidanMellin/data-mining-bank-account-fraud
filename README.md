# README: Bank Account Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project aims to detect and analyze trends in bank account fraud using various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and Decision Tree algorithms. The data set comprises various fields like age, income, country of request origin, and credit risk score.

### EDA Related to Hypotheses

- **Purpose**: To investigate the original hypotheses related to age and income.
- **Techniques Used**: Various types of data visualizations and statistical analyses.
- **Key Findings**: 
  - Approximately 75% of fraudulent applications were from people in their 30's-50's.
  - Risk of fraud appears to increase with age.

### EDA for Other Interesting Fields

- **Purpose**: To explore other fields that are not directly related to our original hypotheses but look interesting.
- **Techniques Used**: Data visualizations and cross-field comparisons.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Higher chances of fraud were observed for requests originating from a foreign country.
  - Different behavior was noticed in credit risk scores between valid and fraudulent applications.

---

### Notes for Report

- Various EDA techniques were performed that relate to the original hypotheses.
- Additional insights were obtained for other fields that initially seemed unrelated to the hypotheses.
- Confidence intervals were calculated for mean age and mean income.

---

### Decision Tree Implementation

- **Purpose**: To build a predictive model for fraud detection.
- **Techniques Used**: Decision Tree algorithms were used for the implementation.
- **Key Findings**: The Decision Tree model was fine-tuned through various iterations to optimize its performance.
